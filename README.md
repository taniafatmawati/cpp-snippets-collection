# C++ Code Snippets Collection 🚀

Welcome to my **C++ Code Snippets Collection**! This repository is a compilation of various C++ scripts and code snippets that I created during my time in college. These scripts demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques in C++.

---

## 🌟 Introduction

This repository contains a diverse set of C++ code snippets, each focusing on different programming topics and challenges. The scripts vary in complexity, from basic operations to more advanced algorithms, making this collection a valuable resource for learning and revisiting key C++ concepts.

## 🛠️ Scripts Overview

Below is a summary of the types of scripts included in this repository:

- **🔤 Basic Syntax and Operations:** Examples include variable declarations, loops, conditionals, and basic I/O operations.
- **📂 Data Structures:** Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and more.
- **🧮 Algorithms:** Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort), searching algorithms (e.g., binary search), and recursion.
- **📄 File Handling:** Basic examples of managing data using file I/O operations.
- **🔧 Miscellaneous:** Various utility scripts and small problem-solving exercises.
